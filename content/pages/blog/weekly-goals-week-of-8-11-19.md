Happy Monday and welcome to another weekly roundup! This is my weekly thread on what I did or didn't do last week, what happened, and what my goals are for this new week. Let's get started!

## Last Week’s Goals

*   3 Blog Posts

*   *One of which being my first technical blog* ✅

*   Meeting with my mentor

*   Continue working on JS 30 ✅

*   Portfolio Redesign ✅

*   *Anything I create I want to be clean, semantic, and meaningful - No extra fluff*

*   *Include some JS but don't rely on it*

*   Continue working through my Treehouse Track ✅

*   *Bonus: Start my React course on Udemy*

## What Happened?

Let's get through what I didn't get done last week.

*   Writing 3 Blog Posts

I didn't have anything new or exciting for my "Journey to My New Career" series and this is the first week I didn't write anything for it. I'm not too upset about it, however, as I was able to get [my first technical blog](/blog/simple-javascript-theme-toggle) out into the world! I'd like to write more of these as I continue learning so I can give back and hopefully help all of you out in some way, shape, or form!

*   Meeting with my mentor

I try to have a weekly video call with my mentor, [Benjamin Lannon](https://twitter.com/lannonbr), who I found via [coadingcoach.io](https://codingcoach.io/). This week, however, I did not feel well and accidentally slept through our appointment - sorry, Ben!

*I already spoke to him regarding this - if you ever have a mentor or teacher please communicate with them as much as you can. Remember, they are giving up their time to you.*

## Moving Forward

My new portfolio site is almost done! This is what I have been working on the most and I am very excited to unveil it. I am hoping to complete it by next Saturday, August 17th. Here's a quick peak:

After my portfolio site is done, I have a new project to work on - a website for my father's local business. This is going to be the biggest site and project I've worked on but I have some great ideas and want to get it underway for him.

### This Week’s Goals 8/12/19 - 8/18/19

*   Finish portfolio site redesign

*   Write blog about portfolio site redesign

*   Video call with mentor

*   Continue working on Wes Bos' [JS 30](https://javascript30.com/)

*   Get started on new project

*   KEEP LEARNING JAVASCRIPT

I feel like my goals are just kind of broad lately. Learn this, keep working on that, write blogs. But that is what I am doing right now - learning and absorbing as much as possible. Writing these blogs helps me reflect on the past week and see where I was and where I'm going.

As usual, feel free to comment down below or you can always reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRyanFurrer).
