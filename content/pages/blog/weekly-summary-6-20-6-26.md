Welcome to a new series I want to keep up during my focused stints of coding and learning I've entitled "Weekly Summary" - very creative, no? I actually used to write a similar post previously on [DEV](https://dev.to/theryanfurrer/series/1554) and really enjoyed it so why not start it up again?

These are meant to be quick recaps for what I worked on the previous week to help keep myself accountable. First, let's go over my weekly schedule:

### Current Weekly Schedule

*   **Monday - Thursday**: Study from 6:00pm - 8:00pm-ish. I'll go until 9 depending on how I'm feeling.

*   **Friday**: Study from 1:00pm - 4:00pm I like to give myself more time to study when I can and working half-day Fridays for my regular job is a great way to get in some extra time.

*   **Saturday**: Study from 7:30am - 9:30am I give myself at least 2 hours on Saturdays even though I can often get in more time.

*   **Sunday**: Day off This is my day to recoup, get energized, and prepare for the coming week!

This all works with my personal goal of studying/coding 2 hours per day. I would love to do more but I don't have the mental bandwidth throughout the week to do more, typically.

So without further adieu let's get into this week's recap!

## Weekly Recap

### Monday, June 21st

I had to cancel my coding plans at the last minute due to plans being made for me, unfortunately. As much as I try and control every part of my day that is very much impossible some days - especially when your brother is visiting from out of town.

### Tuesday, June 22nd

I spent my lunch hour studying and reviewing JavaScript on [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) Go as I had plans this evening with a friend out of town. It is unfortunate that this was 2 days in a row but sometimes that's how it goes...

### Wednesday, June 23rd

Worked on my new [portfolio site](https://theryanfurrer.dev) (coming soon) and write the outline for this blog post.

### Thursday, June 24th

Continued working on my new portfolio site and decided to change priorities from working on 3 different things per week to 1-2 until my portfolio is complete. I wrote more about this on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRyanFurrer/status/1408258759772753922?s=20).

### Friday, June 25th

Tried (and failed) to get a mailchimp plugin working on Coding Catchup. React and Gatsby are still new to me so I'm not feeling too down about this as annoying as it was at the time. [Justin Juno](https://twitter.com/justinjunodev) sent me a blog post on achieving this that I look forward to using to get this done.

### Saturday, June 26th

Worked on my portfolio site and decided to aim to finish it (for now) next week. After that I'm looking forward to getting back to Stephen Grider's "[Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wz0BUoceVxTRHo=/)" course on Udemy and hitting it hard.

## Moving Forward

I'm looking forward to finishing up my portfolio site through this week and getting back to work on learning React. I also committed to [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode\&src=typeahead_click) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRyanFurrer) so if you're interested be sure to follow me there!
