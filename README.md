# ryanfurrer-blog-v1
While I have built personal blogs before, this was the first time using a CMS and no-code solution. While [Netlify Create, formerly Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/), can be used as a no-code solution, it is very much developer focused which is why I liked it as an option for my blog at the time. This blog was launched alongside [ryanfurer-v4](https://github.com/ryanfurrer/ryanfurrer-v4).
