Welcome to the fourth installment in my weekly summary series, where I give quick recaps of what I worked on the previous week to keep myself accountable.

First, let's go over my weekly schedule:

## Current Weekly Schedule

*   **Monday - Thursday**: Study from 6:00pm - 8:00pm-ish.
    Sometimes I go until 9pm depending on how I feel.

*   **Friday**: Study from 1:00pm - 4:00pm
    I like to give myself more time to study when I can, and working half-days on Fridays for my current job leaves a significant time for extra coding.

*   **Saturday**: Study from 7:30am - 9:30am
    I give myself at least 2 hours on Saturdays, even though I often get more time in.

*   **Sunday**: Day off
    This is my day to recover, get energized and prepare for the coming week!

All this works with my personal goal of studying / coding 2 hours a day. I would like to do more, but I don't have the mental bandwidth to do more, usually, throughout the week.

I don't always stick to this schedule, but I try my best to do so.
Now then, let's get to it!

## Sunday, July 11th

Completed the code re-factoring of my [wedding website](http://furrever.wedding/). I normally don't like to do work on Sundays, but with last week being a light week of coding, I believed it was wise to add the extra day.

## Monday, July 12th

Putzed around with Gatsby plugins and failed to get one working that would allow me to embed tweets on [Coding Catchup](http://codingcatchup.com/) - I will try this again in the near future!

Published last week's Weekly Summary on [Coding Catchup](http://codingcatchup.com/) and [Dev.to](http://dev.to/)

Worked on a new blog post about building my [portfolio](http://theryanfurrer.dev/) - coming soon!

## Tuesday, July 13th

Studied React

Added more content to my [wedding website](http://furrever.wedding/) - a [honeymoon fund](https://www.honeyfund.com/)!

## Wednesday, July 14th

Studied React

## Thursday, July 15th

Brainstormed ideas for React projects.
While this could be an easy thing to do and simply commit to building the "go-to" projects like to-do lists, calculators, etc., I want to do more than that...

That being said, I also need to start building and cannot get caught in "tutorial or course hell." That is, merely consuming content on *how* to build things, but never actually doing it.

I also squeezed in some studying of React - I found a free resource by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) who created the acclaimed [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) so I thought I'd give it a shot. This is hosted on [egghead.io](http://egghead.io/) - "[The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react)" - I only just started, but am expecting to get through it all early next week!

## Friday, July 16th

Friday was a light night - I had a hectic week and needed some downtime with my fiancée. Regardless, I still added some more content to my wedding website - this time it was the hotel information for our guests! I think the site is 99.9% complete and can't see myself making radical changes or adding a ton more to it. I had other wedding stuff to take care of this night, which added to the light night of coding.

Today also concluded my 2nd stint of working in [dip.chat](http://dip.chat/) - an accountability group for web developers built by [Joe Previte](https://twitter.com/jsjoeio/status/1416054213809901568?s=20). I cannot recommend dip.chat enough - or even just having an accountability-buddy - some way to keep yourself accountable has been *huge* for me these last 2 months.

## Saturday, July 17th

Finished writing up this blog post and scheduled it for publishing.
Wrote out my weekly newsletter, which I am still experimenting with. I am trying out a different format this week, rather than simply making the body of email contain this same blog post.

I also continued to work on my blog post about building my new portfolio. I ran out of time to study React, but there is always next week!

## Moving Forward

This week I am trying to dive deeper into React. I'm almost done reviewing what I had learned previously in my [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) so that I feel more confident moving forward in it. I am also racking my brain for websites/apps that I could begin building to create not only portfolio projects, but eventually turn them into real products.

As my former passion in my life, I want to build something for musicians. It would be so fulfilling for me to provide value for the friends and colleagues who have helped me along the way by eliminating a pain-point for them. We'll see what happens in the coming months!

If you don’t already, I’d love you to follow my journey to becoming a web developer on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRyanFurrer) where I’ve committed to and post updates daily! Come and say hi, I’d love to support you.
