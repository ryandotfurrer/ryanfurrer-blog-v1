Happy Monday and welcome to another weekly roundup! This is my weekly thread on what I did or didn't do last week, what happened, and what my goals are for this new week. Let's get started!

## Last Week’s Goals

*   Finish portfolio site redesign

*   Write blog about portfolio site redesign ✅

*   Video call with mentor ✅

*   Continue working on Wes Bos' [JS 30](https://javascript30.com/) ✅

*   Get started on new project

*   KEEP LEARNING JAVASCRIPT ✅

## What Happened?

I had less time than I anticipated to complete my portfolio redesign this weekend. I still have to complete the following items:

*   Add dark theme toggle to website

*   I've already designed the dark theme, added the CSS Variables, and created the classes necessary. I just need to implement the JS.

*   Increase whitespace between items on page.

*   Ensure all padding/margins are consistent

*Firstly*, because I did not complete my website, I wasn't able to get started on my new projects. I don't think this will affect me in the long run but it would've been nice to wrap up a project at the end of the week.

*Secondly*, I had a slight change in the design of my site - just the colors and profile picture. I had debated for a while to stick with the profile picture or not but in the end I decided to create and use my logo. In using the logo I had to change the header colors.

## Moving Forward

*   Add JS to portfolio site for Dark Theme

*   Increase the white space between elements by increasing margin & padding

*   Ensure padding/margins are consistent throughout site.

*   Do more work on resume

*   Design rough draft(s) of new project(s) will look like

*   I have not decided what to work on first but I've a few options: doMore (to-do list), a website for my favorite local brewery, [DUBCO](https://www.instagram.com/dubco\_/), or a website for my [father's business](https://www.facebook.com/WallysSpottedDogOrganics/).

*   Continue learning JS and React

Another full week is on tap here but that's okay! I do feel like I need a day off, however, I might push through until [Classic WoW](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic) releases next week - is anyone planning on playing? I'll be on the Stalagg server!
