## Getting My S\*\*t Together

Hey there DEV following, it's been a while...which I said in my last article I wrote in October 2019. A lot has went on since then in my personal life, although my learning has sort of stalled. This is very much the opposite of what I want and need to be doing which leads me into the next topic of this post...

## 2020 Plans

I could of course make extravagant plans and resolutions, but instead, I want to work on developing habits that will help me work toward my goals, both personally and professionally.

A fantastic book that I am re-reading to help me on this journey is "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. If you've not read it yet I highly encourage you all to do so.

### New Habits

*   Wake up by 6:30am during the work week (Monday - Friday)

*   Meditate daily for at least 10 minutes

*   Read 2x per week for at least 1-hour per session

*   Code 5x per week for at least 1-hour per session

*   Go to gym 2x per week

*   Go on 3 walks per week for at least 15 minutes each

These are the most important habits to me that I build, and you'll notice that they are all rooted in personal development.

## New Coding Mentality

This is something I'd like to expand on in a future post, however, I am looking at web design and project development in a different light lately. Long story short, I am trying to keep things simpler, not get caught up in the fine details as I'm building something new, and force myself to try new things.

Like I said, I'll expand on this in a future post, but so far it seems to be working pretty well and I am enjoying the lack of stress I was putting on myself.

## The Curse of Being Too Curious

I am extremely curious with wanting to know what is the best way to do something. This has been crippling me occasionally while coding - let me explain.

I often do too much research before starting something new. There is so much information readily available online these days that it's easy to rabbit-hole yourself into reading and reading and watching and watching before taking the first step...in my case that's simply writing code!

It's an annoying habit of mine, one I'd like to break. I would imagine I'm not alone in this, so I was wondering if any of you could suggest how to overcome or work through this paralyzation?
