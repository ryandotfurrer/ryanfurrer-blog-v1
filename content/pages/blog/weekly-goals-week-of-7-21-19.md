Hello and welcome to a new series of mine, Weekly Goals. I wanted to separate this from my other series, "Journey to My New Career" because although these goals will help me with my career, separating it makes it easier for me to easily go back and see what I accomplished that past week.

*Note: I plan my week starting on Monday, so Sunday is the last day of my week that I have to complete my goals.*

Let's get into it.

## Last Week's Goals

*   Rework my site to incorporate CSS Grid

*   Finish at least 3 courses on Treehouse - *6.5 hours*

*   Post at least 2 blogs

While this doesn't seem like a lot, I knew that the 6.5 hours of Treehouse would take closer to at least 8 hours. Between taking breaks, getting distracted, or struggling to understand JavaScript, time adds up. 

I'm happy to say I have successfully completed everything on my list this week! I have definitely noticed some anxiety and pressure I am putting on myself that I'm not a fan of, however, I think I need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Part of that involves my deep dive into learning JavaScript this past week.

## Goals

*   Start working with Figma

*   Build and practice with JavaScript

    *   To-Do List

    *   Hamburger Menu on Portfolio Site

    *   Dark Theme toggle on Portfolio Site

    *   *Possible* JavaScript 30 Challenges

## Why I Set These Goals

### Figma

If you don't know what [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is, it's a competitor to [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) - a design tool. I'll go more into depth why I want to learn Figma and why I'm choosing to use it in my blog post later this week.

### Building and Practicing with JavaScript

I've written before about the importance of practicing what you're learning and JavaScript is going to take a lot of practice! I've chosen the above mentioned projects as I know I'll be able to use them in the future - might as well start becoming proficient at them.

### JavaScript 30 Challenges

[These](https://javascript30.com/) challenges, created by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) are something I've heard *great* things about from numerous people. This will just be another form of practice for me.

I will possibly be starting these this week simply because I'm not sure how far I'll be able to get.

So this is everything I've got planned this coming week. I'm sure some light Treehouse work will be thrown in there but we'll see how the JavaScript projects go.

What are some of your goals or projects for this week? Let me know in the comments below or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRyanFurrer)!
